"""Custom item tags — free-form labels (signed, first-edition, book-club…)
edited as chips on the item detail page and filterable on Browse.

`tags.media_type` (nullable) is an *advisory* scope: NULL means the tag is
global, and nothing here strips or refuses an out-of-scope association —
that is a settled design decision, not an omission.

Every function here takes the caller's own `db` connection and never opens
one of its own — callers already hold one, often inside a write
transaction, so nothing in this module logs (a second connection opened to
write a log record would block on the caller's in-flight write until
SQLite's busy timeout).

Add-time default tags ride the item's own transaction: an add route wraps
its body in `default_tags(raw)`, and `item_write.insert_item` calls
`attach_pending` on the connection that inserted or restored the row. The
item and its tags commit together or not at all (G118).
